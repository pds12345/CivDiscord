# CivDiscord

A Discord ↔ Minecraft bridge bot for Civ-style servers (CivPVP, Eden, anywhere using CivModCore + JukeAlert + NameLayer). Replaces the Kira bridge bot with a leaner, plugin-only deploy: **one Velocity plugin + one Paper companion**. No broker. No Postgres. No dedicated bot host.

## Features

- Discord ↔ MC chat relay scoped per NameLayer chat group
- Multi-bind channels: one Discord channel can bind several NameLayer groups — one **writer** (2-way) plus read-only **readers** (`/relay writer <group>` to pick the writer)
- The high-traffic global group `!` can only be relayed from the home guild, to avoid rate-limiting every other relay
- JukeAlert snitch alerts forwarded to Discord
- Player login/logout feed: one Discord channel mirroring proxy connect / disconnect / server-switch activity, bound with `/loginfeed bind` (home guild only)
- Live server stats: player count, TPS, uptime, peak concurrent, and unique/new players — shown as bot presence, an auto-updating embed dashboard, optional DiscordSRV-style voice/topic labels, and an on-demand `/status`. Bound with `/stats` (home guild only)
- `/admin run <server> <command>` console executor
- In-game ↔ Discord account linking (`/discord link` → `/link <code>`), mintable from the proxy or a Paper backend
- Per-guild "verified" auth role on link
- Multi-guild: invite the bot to faction/nation Discords; each manages its own relay rooms
- Optional Patreon role sync

## Creating the Discord bot

Before installing, register an application with Discord:

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**. Name it whatever you want — players see your bot's username, not the application name.
2. Go to the **Bot** tab. Click **Reset Token** and copy the new token — this is the value you'll put in `discord.token` (or `CIVDISCORD_DISCORD_TOKEN`) later. The token is shown only once.
3. Still on the **Bot** tab, scroll to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and enable **both**:
   - **Server Members Intent** — required for role grants on link and for member-cache lookups.
   - **Message Content Intent** — required for Discord→MC chat relay.

   If you skip either, the bot will fail to connect with `WebSocket closed with code 4014` / `DISALLOWED_INTENTS` on startup.
4. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator** (or use the template below), pick scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`, then pick the permissions listed under [Bot invite scopes & permissions](#bot-invite-scopes--permissions). Use the resulting URL to invite the bot to your home guild.

   Pre-built invite URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the **Application ID** from the **General Information** tab):

   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=2952817664&scope=bot+applications.commands
   ```

   The `permissions=2952817664` bitmask encodes exactly the permissions documented below. If you customize the permission set, recompute the bitmask via the OAuth2 URL Generator.

## Installing

1. Drop `CivDiscord-Velocity-*.jar` into your Velocity proxy's `plugins/` directory.
2. Drop `CivDiscord-Paper-*.jar` into **each** Paper backend's `plugins/` directory.
3. Start once — both plugins will write default `config.yml` files into their data directories. Note: Velocity writes to `plugins/civdiscord/` (lowercase); Paper writes to `plugins/CivDiscord/` (capital). Case matters on Linux.
4. Edit `velocity/plugins/civdiscord/config.yml`:

```yaml
discord:
  token: your-bot-token        # or omit and set CIVDISCORD_DISCORD_TOKEN env var
  home_guild_id: 1234567890
database:
  path: civdiscord.db
namelayer_db:                  # the backend's NameLayer MariaDB — proxy reads it
  host: db.example.com         #   directly for /relay permission checks
  port: 3306
  user: namelayer
  password: ${CIVDISCORD_NAMELAYER_DB_PASSWORD}
  database: citadel
# patreon block optional — see the commented template in the default config.yml.
```

5. Edit each `<paper-backend>/plugins/CivDiscord/config.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  name: citadel    # Velocity's name for this backend
```

6. Restart the proxy + backends.
7. In the home guild, run `/admin guild view` to confirm the bot is online and the config loaded.
8. (Optional) For each invited guild that wants auth-role grants on link, run `/admin guild auth-role role:@yourrole`.

### Bot invite scopes & permissions

Invite the bot with scopes `bot applications.commands` and the following minimum permissions:

- `Manage Roles` (only roles below the bot's top role)
- `Manage Webhooks` (required per relay channel — without it, MC→Discord chat relay is disabled and Discord shows only the bot's plain text echo)
- `Manage Messages` (required per relay channel — used to delete the user's original message after the webhook re-posts it under their MC name)
- `View Channels`
- `Send Messages`
- `Use Slash Commands`
- `Embed Links` (for snitch alerts and the stats dashboard)
- `Manage Channels` (optional — only if you use `/stats` voice-channel or topic surfaces; lets the bot rename those channels / edit the topic)

Do **NOT** grant `Administrator`. The bot does not need it.

## Migrating from Kira

If you're cutting over from an existing upstream Kira deploy, read this first. CivDiscord does **not** share storage with Kira, and a naive swap silently drops every existing account link.

### What does not transfer

- **Account bindings.** Kira's Postgres `discord_id ↔ minecraft_uuid` table is schema-incompatible with CivDiscord's SQLite store. There is no importer. Every player must re-link via `/discord link` (in-game) → `/link <code>` (Discord). Announce a re-link window (48h is typical) in `#announcements` and your in-game MOTD before cutover.
- **Patreon role state.** CivDiscord recomputes tiers on its first sync after install. Expect supporter roles to be momentarily stale (up to one sync interval) for users who have already re-linked.
- **Bridged chat history.** Neither system backfills the gap during cutover. Unavoidable.

### What is reusable

- **Discord channel IDs** Kira was bridging to. Point CivDiscord's `/relay bind` at the same channels.
- **Webhook URLs** in those channels — CivDiscord will reuse an existing webhook if one is present and it has `Manage Webhooks`, or create a new one if not.
- **Bot token and Patreon OAuth credentials.** Reuse the same Discord application and the same Patreon `access_token` / `refresh_token` you fed Kira. (You can also rotate at this point — it's a convenient moment.)

### Cutover order (operator)

1. **Preserve Kira state.** Before stopping Kira, snapshot Postgres (`pg_dump`) and RabbitMQ definitions (`rabbitmqctl export_definitions`) somewhere safe. Keep these and the live data volumes around for **at least 2 weeks** — they are your only rollback path.
2. **Stop the Kira bot container** (leave RabbitMQ + Postgres running for now).
3. **Remove `kira-gateway` jars** from each backend's `plugins/` directory.
4. **Install CivDiscord** per [Installing](#installing) above.
5. **Run post-cutover admin commands:**
   - `/admin guild view` — confirm the bot is online and config loaded.
   - `/admin guild auth-role role:@yourrole` — per invited guild that wants verified-role grants on link.
   - `/relay bind <group>` in each channel that used to be a Kira relay room — CivDiscord doesn't read Kira's routes. (The binder must hold `READ_CHAT` in that NameLayer group.)
6. **Announce re-link.** Players run `/discord link` in-game, then `/link <code>` in Discord.

### Rollback

CivDiscord does not touch Kira's RabbitMQ or Postgres, so as long as you preserved them (step 1 above), rollback is:

1. Stop and remove CivDiscord (`CivDiscord-Velocity-*.jar` from Velocity, `CivDiscord-Paper-*.jar` from each backend).
2. Redeploy the Kira jars (`kira` container + per-server `kira-gateway` plugins).
3. Restart the proxy and backends.

Any binding a user established on CivDiscord during the window is lost on rollback; they go back to their Kira-era binding. Tell affected users.

After ~2 weeks of clean CivDiscord operation, you can delete the RabbitMQ + Postgres data volumes and close out the rollback window.

## Permissions

Authorization rides on Discord's native application-command permissions. Defaults are intentionally narrow; guild owners can widen or narrow them via **Server Settings → Integrations → CivDiscord**. The defaults are:

| Command | Default permission | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/link <code>` | `@everyone` | any guild the bot is in |
| `/me` | `@everyone` | any guild the bot is in |
| `/discord link`, `/discord status` | all players | the Velocity proxy or any backend |
| `/relay …` | `MANAGE_CHANNELS` (per-channel) | the channel it's run in |
| `/admin guild …` | `MANAGE_SERVER` (per-guild) | the guild it's run in — affects only that guild's auth role + relay roster |
| `/admin user …` | `MANAGE_SERVER` in the home guild | cross-network |
| `/admin run …` | `MANAGE_SERVER` in the home guild | dispatches console commands to **any** backend |
| `/loginfeed …` | `MANAGE_SERVER` in the home guild | the channel it's bound to |
| `/status` | `@everyone` | home guild |
| `/stats …` | `MANAGE_SERVER` in the home guild | home guild (voice/topic surfaces also need the bot to hold `Manage Channels`) |

Note: a Discord guild owner can override these defaults from the Integrations UI. CivDiscord adds no second Discord-layer authorization — if Discord lets the user invoke the command, the bot trusts it. The one exception is NameLayer gating on relay binds: `/relay bind` and `/relay writer` require the invoker (a linked account) to hold `READ_CHAT` in the target NameLayer group, and turning on `show-snitches` requires `SNITCH_NOTIFICATIONS`. These are read from the backend's NameLayer MariaDB (`namelayer_db`).

## Live server stats

The bot can surface live server stats in Discord. In the home guild, an admin (`MANAGE_SERVER`) binds the surfaces with `/stats`:

- `/stats dashboard-set` — post an auto-updating embed (players X/max, TPS, uptime, peak today/all-time, unique/new players) in the current channel; it refreshes about once a minute and self-heals if deleted.
- `/status` — anyone can pull the same stats on demand (ephemeral), plus the current online roster.
- `/stats players-channel <vc>` / `/stats tps-channel <vc>` — rename voice channels to show the headline numbers (DiscordSRV-style). These update at most every ~10 minutes — Discord's channel-edit limit — and need `Manage Channels`.
- `/stats topic-add` / `topic-remove` — add or drop the current channel's topic stats line (you can add several channels); `/stats topic-clear` clears them all. Also ~10 min, and topics show a literal UTC time rather than a live timestamp.
- `/stats show` lists what's bound; `/stats dashboard-clear`, `voice-clear`, and `topic-clear` unbind.

TPS and uptime come from each Paper backend over the bridge; when the server is empty there's no carrier player to ferry the frame, so TPS shows `—` (the count is 0 anyway). Cadence and limits live in the Velocity `config.yml`:

```yaml
stats:
  enabled: true
  max_players: 150          # shown as X/max; 0 hides the denominator
  fast_seconds: 60          # presence + embed refresh
  slow_minutes: 10          # voice/topic refresh (Discord's floor)
  metrics_stale_seconds: 90 # TPS older than this shows as a dash
```

and how often each backend reports, in that backend's `config.yml`:

```yaml
metrics:
  interval_seconds: 30
```

## Operator runbook

### Rotating the bot token

1. Generate a new token in the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Edit `velocity/plugins/civdiscord/config.yml` and replace `discord.token`, **or** set `CIVDISCORD_DISCORD_TOKEN` in the proxy's environment and delete the `token:` line.
3. Restart the proxy. The Paper backends do not hold the token.

### Patreon access-token refresh

Patreon access tokens expire after ~31 days. If you've configured Patreon sync:

- Provide a `refresh_token` alongside `access_token` in `config.yml`. The bot will rotate the access token automatically when it expires and log the rotation.
- If the refresh token itself is revoked or expires (~1 year), Patreon role sync will start logging `ERROR` lines on every sweep. Re-authorize via the Patreon Creator Dashboard and update both fields.

### Database backup

The SQLite DB runs in WAL mode, so online backups are safe while the bot is running:

```bash
sqlite3 velocity/plugins/civdiscord/civdiscord.db ".backup civdiscord-$(date +%F).bak"
```

Schedule this from cron or your backup system. The DB is small (KBs–low MBs); keep daily snapshots.

### Recovering from a corrupt DB

The DB only holds link bindings, per-guild relay routes, guild config, and Patreon tier caches — none of it is irreplaceable.

1. Stop the proxy.
2. Move the corrupt `civdiscord.db` (and `-wal` / `-shm` siblings) aside.
3. Start the proxy. A fresh DB will be created and migrations re-run.
4. Operators re-run `/admin guild auth-role`, `/relay` for each channel, and players re-link via `/discord link` → `/link <code>`.

### Enabling debug logs

Add to your proxy's `logback.xml` (or backend's):

```xml
<logger name="io.github.grepsedawk.civdiscord" level="DEBUG"/>
```

Or set per-package, e.g. `…civdiscord.velocity.bridge` for just bridge traffic.

### Troubleshooting

- **`WebSocket closed with code 4014`** / **`DISALLOWED_INTENTS`** at startup: you forgot to enable the privileged intents in the Discord Developer Portal. Re-read [Creating the Discord bot](#creating-the-discord-bot) and toggle on **Server Members Intent** and **Message Content Intent** under the Bot tab.
- **`InvalidTokenException`** / `4004` close code: the token in `config.yml` (or `CIVDISCORD_DISCORD_TOKEN`) is wrong or was reset. Generate a new one via **Bot → Reset Token** and update the config.
- **Bot online but `/relay`, `/admin`, etc. don't appear**: you invited the bot without the `applications.commands` scope. Re-invite using the URL from [Creating the Discord bot](#creating-the-discord-bot).

## Vendored libraries

`libs/` ships the Civ plugin primitives (CivModCore, NameLayer, JukeAlert, CivChat2) plus ACF, vendored because they aren't published to a public Maven repository. Every jar in `libs/` has a corresponding entry in [`libs/CHECKSUMS.sha256`](libs/CHECKSUMS.sha256) with source URL and SHA-256.

**Reviewers MUST verify checksums when accepting any PR that touches `libs/`.** CI runs `shasum -a 256 -c libs/CHECKSUMS.sha256` on every push.

To refresh a vendored jar:

1. Download the new release from the source URL.
2. Replace the file in `libs/`.
3. Update its line in `libs/CHECKSUMS.sha256` with the new hash and version comment.
4. Open a PR; the CI checksum job will pass only if your hash matches.

## Threat model

CivDiscord is designed for the standard Civ-style operator: Velocity proxy fronting trusted Paper backends, none directly reachable on the public internet.

- **Bridge protocol** (`civdiscord:bridge` plugin-message channel): proxy↔backend traffic is HMAC-SHA-256 authenticated by default. Velocity auto-generates `plugins/civdiscord/secret.key` on first run — copy it to `plugins/CivDiscord/secret.key` on every Paper backend (e.g. `scp velocity-host:/path/to/secret.key paper-host:/path/to/secret.key`). Note the case difference: Velocity uses `civdiscord` (lower), Paper uses `CivDiscord` (capital). Paper refuses to register the incoming channel until the key is present, so missing-key installs simply ignore bridge frames instead of accepting them unauthenticated. Do not expose Paper backends to direct connections from the public internet.
- **`/admin run`**: anyone with `MANAGE_SERVER` in the home guild can dispatch arbitrary console commands (op, deop, stop, ban-ip, anything). Treat home-guild `MANAGE_SERVER` as equivalent to root on every backend.
- **Link codes**: 12-character codes drawn from a CSPRNG alphabet, single-use, expire after ~10 minutes. Minting is unthrottled, but `/link <code>` redemption is rate-limited per Discord user. Each redemption is audit-logged. Codes are *not* secret long-term — they're one-shot — but the link flow prints them in plain in-game chat (see streamer note below).
- **Discord-side authorization** is entirely delegated to Discord's app-command permission system. CivDiscord does no second authorization check. Guild owners who widen defaults via the Integrations UI accept the consequences.
- **Patreon credentials** (if configured) are read from disk only. The bot does not log refresh tokens. Restrict `config.yml` permissions to `0600`.

### Streamer / content-creator note

`/discord link` prints the generated code in plain in-game chat. Streamers and content creators should be aware that codes are screenshot- and clip-leakable. Mitigations already in place:

- Codes are single-use and short-lived (TTL on the order of minutes).
- Each Discord user is rate-limited on `/link` attempts.
- Every redemption is audit-logged with timestamp + Discord user + claimed MC UUID.

If you accidentally publish a live code, just generate a new one via `/discord link` again — the old one expires immediately if redeemed, and naturally on TTL.

## Building from source

```bash
mise exec -- ./gradlew :velocity:shadowJar :paper:shadowJar
# Output: velocity/build/libs/CivDiscord-Velocity-*.jar
#         paper/build/libs/CivDiscord-Paper-*.jar
```

Requires Java 25 (pinned via `mise.toml`).

## Architecture

Gradle multi-module project:

- `core/` — pure-JVM domain logic: the bridge `Payload` codec, Exposed/SQLite DAOs and numbered migrations, the Patreon client, relay routing, and `MarkdownSafe` output escaping. No Velocity/Paper API on the classpath, so it unit-tests on a plain JVM.
- `velocity/` — the proxy plugin: JDA gateway, slash commands (`/link`, `/me`, `/relay`, `/admin`, `/loginfeed`, `/stats`, `/status`) plus a proxy `/discord` command that mints link tokens locally (no Paper round-trip), snitch fan-out, the chat relay router, and the live server-stats publishers.
- `paper/` — the backend plugin: JukeAlert snitch listener, CivChat2 hooks, console executor, and the `/discord` tree (fallback for backends).

Velocity and each Paper backend talk over the `civdiscord:bridge` plugin-message channel, framed as kotlinx.serialization JSON `Payload`s and signed with HMAC-SHA-256 (shared `secret.key`, on by default). Plugin messages need a connected player to ferry them, so NameLayer permission checks bypass the bridge and query the backend's MariaDB directly from the proxy (`namelayer_db` config). A Discord channel binds to one or more NameLayer groups: one **writer** (2-way) plus read-only **readers**; Discord-origin chat is fanned out in-process to every channel bound to the writer's group.

State lives in a per-proxy SQLite DB (WAL, foreign keys). All user-controlled strings pass through `MarkdownSafe` before reaching Discord.
